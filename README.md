# Data Wrangling and Analysis Project
This project involved using a real world dataset from OpenStreetMap's API and processing the data into a database. After the data is loaded, I then perform some exploratory analysis on the data. For resources used in assistance with this project, look at [this](DataWrangling/sources.txt). For a summary report of my work, please read [this](DataWrangling/DataWrangling_Report.pdf).

# Data Acquisition and Initial Cleaning
The goal of this [code notebook](DataWrangling/DataAuditing.ipynb) is to parse and do some inital cleaning on the OpenStreetMap raw data. 

# In-depth Cleaning
The goal of this [code notebook](DataWrangling/DataCleaning.ipynb) is to do some more deep cleaning on the dataset and save the data into csv format.

# Database Creation and Analysis
The goal of this [code notebook](DataWrangling/database.ipynb) is to load the data into a SQLite Database and do some analysis. I focused on looking at the most popular points of interests in the San Francisco Bay Area.
